// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items
// Create an array of countries
var countries = ["Pakistan", "NewYourk", "Japan", "China", "Hong Kong"];
console.log("List of Countries:");
// the array using a for...of loop
for (var _i = 0, countries_1 = countries; _i < countries_1.length; _i++) {
    var country = countries_1[_i];
    //  // Print each country in the array
    console.log(country);
}
